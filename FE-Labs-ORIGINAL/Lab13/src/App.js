/* ------------------ Part 1: Creating a Nav Bar Component --------------------- */
/**
 * Step 1: Create a new file in our src folder called Nav.js
 * Step 2: Create the base format for a class-based component.
 *         Inside of the return(), return: <nav>Nav</nav>
 * Step 3: In your App.js, import your <Nav> component inside of the div in return()
 *         You should now see the text 'Nav' on your app.
 *         Don't forget to 'npm start' in the console if you aren't on a live server yet.
 * Step 4: In your Nav.js file, add an <ul>, and 3 <li> inside your <nav> element.
 *         The text inside the 3 <li> should be: Home, Portfolio, and Contact
 * Step 5: Style your Nav component using the app.css file.
 *         Give your <nav> element: 100vw
 *                                  (100 view width makes the width the size of their screen)
 *         Give your <ul> element: display: flex, flex-direction: row, justify-content: right
 *         The rest is up to you! Consider pseudo:selectors, such as hover/active/touch
 *
 *         Alternatively, refer to Week 9 and use bootstrap instead.
 *         Remember when we give elements classes in React, we use className=""
 * */

/* ------------------ Part 2: Creating a Welcome Section --------------------- */
/**
 *  Step 1: Copy/paste the code below above your function App() & below your imports
 *           let date = new Date()
 *
 *           let singleUser = {
 *             name: 'John',
 *             time: date.toDateString(),
 *           }
 *
 * Step 2: Below your <Nav/> component, create a <section> element to hold our Welcome section
 * Step 3: Create a <h1> element inside our <div> and welcome our singleUser.
 *         Use our singleUser object instead of typing out their name.
 *         Hint: Use {} inside of HTML to use JavaScript
 *
 *         Create a <p> tag, and inside of it explain todays date
 *         Make sure to refer to the object instead of hard-coding what today is.
 *
 * Step 4: Style our new welcome section using the app.css file. Make it your own!
 *         Suggested: Center it on the page
 *                    Increase the font size since it's considered 'call to action'
 *                    Consider capitalizing/line-spacing the <h1>, (text-transform/decoration)
 *                    Change the font color so it's legible over your background color
 *                    Change the margin-top so there's reasonable space from <nav>
