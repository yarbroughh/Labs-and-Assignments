/*------------------------ Part 1: REST & Fetch ------------------------*/

/**
 * Fetch documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
 *
 *                      Make sure you set up a API that you can CRUD to, such as mockAPI or use
 *                      a JSON server like in the week 11/12 labs.
 *
 *                      The lab solution will use mockAPI - but you MUST update the endpoint with your own
 *                      or the CRUD operations will not work. Do not copy the API link in the lab solution.
 *
 * Part 1: Create a new const variable called: API_URL , and set it to your URL.
 *
 *         Create 4 functions, getUsers(){}, deleteUser(){}, updateUser(){}, and postNewUser(){}.
 */

/*------------------------ Part 1: Setting up GET ------------------------*/
/*
 *         Setting up getUsers() function:
 *
 * Step 1: First, let's create a place (state) to save the users from our API.
 *
 * Step 2: In our getUsers function:
 *         1) Use fetch(URL) to get from the API
 *         2) Convert the data to JSON
 *         3) setUsers() to result of that data.
 *

 *
 * Step 3: Use the useEffect and getUsers() to re-render our component on change:
 *
 */

/*------------------------ Part 2: Setting up DELETE ------------------------*/

/**
 * Reminder: fetch(url, {options})
 *
 * Step 1: Put id as a parameter in our deleteUser() function, and update
 *         our URL in fetch(API_URL) with the id parameter.
 *
 * Step 2: Add method: "DELETE" key/value pair to our options object
 *
 * Step 3: call .then(() => getUsers()) after your fetch() to ensure that our component
 *         gets re-rendered with the updated information.
 */

/*------------------------ Part 3: Setting up POST ------------------------*/

/**
 * Step 1: Inside our postNewUser() function, set up fetch() to POST.
 *
 *         Reminder: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
 *
 * Step 2: Create 3 new variables with useState(): newUserName, newUserJobTitle, newUserCompanyName
 *
 *         Set them to an empty string
 *
 *         Update the body: {} part of our fetch() to POST with our new variables.
 */

/*------------------------ Part 4: Setting up UPDATE ------------------------*/

/** Disclaimer: There are MANY ways to handle UPDATE.
 *              This is only one way. We will be creating a form for each user,
 *              passing in a userObject to our updateUser() function, then updating the user with fetch()
 *
 *              Consider other ways after the lab is completed.
 *
 * Step 1: Set up fetch() to UPDATE in our updateUser() function.
 *         Pass in userObject as a parameter.
 *         Be sure to update the URL with userObject.id
 *
 *         Reminder: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
 *
 *         Consider the necessary options key:value pairs; method/headers/body
 *
 * Step 2: Create 3 new variables with useState() like we did for POST, but for UPDATE:
 *         updatedName, updatedJobTitle, and updatedCompanyName
 *
 * Step 3: Inside the updateUser() function body, create a new variable: updatedUserObject
 *         updatedUserObject should be userObject, with it's updated name/title/company name
 *
 */

/*------------------------ Part 5: Connecting All the Pieces ------------------------*/

/**
 * Step 1:  Connecting our GET:
 *
 *          .map over our users variable and display every users name/jobTitle/companyName
 *
 * Step 2: Connecting our DELETE:
 *
 *         Under our map, give every user a button to delete. Return of the trash-bin: ðŸ—‘
 *         It's not in a form, so we don't need event.preventDefault()
 *
 *         use .then(() => getUsers()) after our fetch to re-render the
 *         page with the updated information.
 *
 * Step 3: Connecting our POST:
 *
 *         Create a form above your .map method to post a new user.
 *
 *         Use the onChange property and setMyVariable() on each corresponding input
 *
 *         Connect your postNewUser() function to your form button.
 *
 *         We do need event.preventDefault() because it's inside of a form.
 *
 *         You should now be POSTing new users! Is your state re-rendering?
 *         If not, your hint in how is in Part 2: Setting up DELETE
 *
 * Step 4: Connecting our UPDATE:
 *
 *     1)  There's MANY ways to handle UPDATE.
 *
 *         For this example, we're going to give every user a form to update their:
 *         name, job title, and company name.
 *
 *     2)   Inside our .map() method, below our delete button,
 *          create a new form with labels/inputs for
 *          Update name, update job title, update company name.
 *          Include a button at the bottom (this will update on click).
 *
 *     3)   Set up the onChange property on your inputs similiar to Step 3: Connecting our POST
 *
 *     4)   Give your button an onClick property. Connect your updateUser() function to it.
 *
 *          For this function, we have two goals:
 *       1. Prevent the button from refreshing the page
 *       2. Pass in a an entire user object.
 *
 *          Set up your onClick to do both.
 *
 *     5)   Test it out! Your update should now be working!
 *          Make sure the page is re-rendering with the updated information
 *          and not refreshing the page.
 *
 * Optional: Set the input values in your update form to be equal to user.name/user.jobTitle etc,
 *           so they don't initially submit empty strings.

/**
 *     While this lab focused mostly on functionality over practicality,
 *     here's a couple ideas you can try implementing to make the UI/UX more user-friendly:
 *
 *    1: Having a form laid out for EVERY user isn't very UI friendly, nor realistic.
 *       Consider using a styling library like Bootstrap React/MaterialUI/SemanticUI to put
 *       each of those forms in a modal. The form inside the modal only pops up when a
 *       "update user" button gets clicked, and only updates the user when that modal gets submitted.
 *
 * Docs: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/
 *
 *
 *    2: Organize the users somehow. You can use a table, CSS grid/flex.
 *       Possibly put all the users in a container, and look at the CSS property overflow:
 *
 * Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow
