 *                                     ~Lunch Date~

Question 1: Declaring Let and Const variables`)

/*
 * Step 1: Initialize two variables using 'const' and set the value of those variables to what you're having to eat and drink
 * Step 2: Initialize two more variables using 'let' and set one value to your name, and the other to your friends name.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */

//Question: Name a reason why you would use const instead of let.
//Answer:

/*---------------------------------- Template Literals -------------------------------------*/

Question 2: Template Literals`)

/*
 * Step 1: Using template literals and the variables we just created,
 *         write a sentence describing what you and your friend are eating & drinking for lunch.
 *
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */

//Question: How would the sentence you wrote look if you used string concatenation instead of template literals?
//          console.log() your answer to check
//Answer:
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 2a: Oh no`)

/* Oh no! You just remembered your friend is allergic to the drink we prepared!
 *
 * Step 1: In the section below, reassign your drink item to something else. console.log() your drink variable and run your code.
 * Step 2: Make a change to your code in Question 1 to fix the error. Run your code to make sure it's fixed.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */

console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 3: Arrow Functions`)

/* You and your friend eat together so often that having a new variable for each food/drink
 *     item could get tiring.
 *
 * Let's use functions so we can easily describe what we're eating.
 *
 * Step 1: Using ES6 standards, write a fat arrow function using const called "lunchTime" that
 *         takes in two parameters: foodChoice, and drinkChoice.
 * Step 2: Have the function 'return' the same sentenced you used to describe eating lunch above
 *         but replace the food/drink variables with our newly created parameters.
 * Step 3: Copy the code below, ↓ paste it underneath our new function, and run the code.
 *         console.log(lunchTime('Pizza','Water'))
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */

//Question: What would your function look like if we were using the old way of creating a function?
//Answer:

/*---------------------------------- Callbacks -------------------------------------*/
console.log(`-------------------------- 
Question 4: Callbacks`)

/**
 * You and your friend ALWAYS eat lunch, but it might be a good idea to plan for the next date in advance.
 * Let's use functions and callbacks to describe what we're eating today, and what we want tomorrow.
 *
 * Step 1: Create a ES6 fat arrow function called 'foodForTodayAndTomorrow' that takes 3 parameters: tomorrowsFoodChoice, tomorrowsDrinkChoice, and callbackFunction.
 * Step 2: Have your function return a new string in this format: `${callbackFunction} Tomorrow we want ${tomorrowsFoodChoice} and ${tomorrowsDrinkChoice}.`
 * Step 3: console.log() your new function, foodForTodayAndTomorrow, and pass in lunchTime('newFoodItem', 'newDrinkItem') as the argument for the "callbackFunction" parameter.
 *
 * ↓ YOUR CODE HERE ↓ */
